                Market research transcription involves converting the audio data collected during research into an easily readable market research document. This may include focus group interviews, one on one interviews, opinion polls, surveys and more. Market research is crucial to every business that is dedicated to understanding the market, consumer trends and preferences so that it can develop a better product and also better marketing strategies.
                Market research transcription makes it easier to refer to the information collected during the market research rather keeping on rewinding the audio to extract data. It also ensures accuracy since the information is put word by word as it was said. Caspad is a reliable transcription service and therefore youâ€™ll get your transcript in a clear and concise manner in a timely manner.
