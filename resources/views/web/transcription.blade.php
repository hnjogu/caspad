            <h2> 1. <strong>Verbatim:</strong> Every spoken word is captured. </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All speech is captured word for word from the beginning to the end.</li>
                    <li>Filler words, false starts and stutters are included. E.g., uh, um.</li>
                    <li>Some non-speech sounds are captured. E.g., laughter.</li>
                </ul>
                The transcript is long and speech patterns donâ€™t flow well making it hard to read.
            </p>

            <h2> 2. <strong>Non-Verbatim:</strong> Clean read version transcript. </h2>
            <p>
                Non-verbatim captures only what the speaker actually intended to say. This is our default style for all transcription services and the most commonly requested transcription.

                <ul>
                    <li>The whole recording is captured without paraphrasing or grammar correction.</li>
                    <li>Filler words, false starts and stutters are omitted.</li>
                    <li>Non-speech sounds are omitted.</li>
                </ul>
                Preserves context and meaning of every sentence in the recording while ensuring the readability of the transcript.
